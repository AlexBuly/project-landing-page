# project-landing-page
In this project, I used primarily CSS Flexbox to create a webpage. 

Using the flex exercises as a guide really helped design this page. It is not exact. The margins are quite a bit smaller than the image. 

The most difficult parts of this project include the card sizing and responsiveness. For most of the project, the image container for the 4 images was the right size but the images were not. As it turns out, all that was needed to fix this was obeject-fit: contain. This makes an images resize to fit their container. This header, hero and footer section collaspe fairly well but the rest does not.
